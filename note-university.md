SynopsX is a collective project whose aim is to propose a web application built on BaseX to easily expose and publish XML textual sources and data (mostly encoded in TEI http://tei-c.org/).

Initiated by the Atelier des Humanités Numériques (Digital Humanities Workshop) from École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, SynopsX gathers various french projects in the fields of history and literary studies.

Six participants came in Konstanz for a co-working with BaseX :

- Centre Koyré (Paris, CNRS) http://koyre.in2p3.fr, a laboratory in history of sciences and technics

- The Labex Pasts in the Present (Paris, University Paris-Ouest, Bnf, Maison René Ginouves, etc.) http://passes-present.eu/en an excellence cluster dealing with actualisation of the past in the digital age

- Triangle (Lyon, CNRS ENS) http://triangle.ens-lyon.fr, a pluri-disciplinary laboratory in political thoughts (political sciences, history, philosophy, gender studies...)

- LARHRA (Lyon, ISH CNRS) http://larhra.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr, a laboratory in history

- IHPC (Lyon, CNRS ENS) http://pensee-classique.ens-lyon.fr, a laboratory in philosophy and history of ideas in the modern period

- the TGIR Huma-Num http://www.huma-num.fr is a very large facility which aims to facilitate the digital turn in humanities and social sciences. TGIR Huma-Num coordinates the  participation of France in the European digital research infrastructure for the arts and humanities DARIAH http://www.dariah.fr

The scope of SynopsX is on the one hand to help a single researcher to easily publish, explore and expose their XML data, and on the other hand for ITs teams to collaborate, mutualize and genericize their efforts. The project is candidate to join the facilities offered to researchers in arts and humanities by the TGIR Huma-Num.
